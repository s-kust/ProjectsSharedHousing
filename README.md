These are my Python/Django projects gathered under one roof. Detailed descriptions of each project are available in separate repositories dedicated to them.

Before deployment, prepare the required data for configuration files `db_config.ini` and `/app/config.json`.  Most importantly, you'll need SMTP server data and private_key to access the Google Spreadsheet via its API.

Templates `db_config_template.ini` and `/app/config_template.json` are here to help you fill in the fields in the configuration files. Please note that the database name, username and password must be the same in both files.
